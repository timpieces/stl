# stl

'stl' is a recursive acronym. It stands for "STL for Tim's Learning".
It's a toy project where I can reimplement parts of the STL as a learning exercise.
I'll try to adapt tests from llvm libc++.
I may add an animation layer in future to try to visualize the algorithms.

AI Disclaimer: 
- Some/much of the build infrastructure
- Some/much of the tests
- *None* of the STL implementation
